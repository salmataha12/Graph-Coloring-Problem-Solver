# üé® Graph Coloring Problem Solver

A Python app that solves the **Graph Coloring Problem**, ensuring no two connected nodes share the same color while minimizing the number of colors used.

It supports two algorithms:
- **Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA)**
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**

Built with **Tkinter** for the GUI, **NetworkX** for graph handling, and **Matplotlib** for visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Interactive GUI to build custom graphs  

- Choose between Backtracking or Genetic Algorithm  

- Adjustable GA parameters (population size, mutation rate, etc.)  

- Real-time colored graph visualization  

- Shows time taken and chromatic number
